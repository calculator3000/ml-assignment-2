- Compressing images, reducing number of colors with k-means clustering

Task 2: **Time Series Forecasting**
- Checking if TS is stationary with ADF
- Stationarizing the TS through differencing Vs. deseasonalization
- Finding the hyperparameters for ARIMA model
- Forecasting with ARIMA model

Task 3: **Recommender System**
